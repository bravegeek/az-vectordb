# Implement az-vectordb Checklist Item: [Task Name]

## Context
I'm working on the az-vectordb customer matching system. I need to implement the following checklist item:

**Checklist Item**: [Copy the specific checklist item here]

**Source**: [e.g., Matching Results Display Plan, Vector Match Testing Plan, Matching Testing Plan, etc.]

## Project Context
- **Architecture**: FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL + pgvector database
- **Current Phase**: [Phase 1: API Development | Phase 2: Advanced Features | Testing Phase]
- **Dependencies**: [e.g., Phase 1 API endpoints, database setup, test data, etc.]
- **Environment**: Windows development with PowerShell

## Expert Personas Needed
Based on the cursor rules, please adopt these expert personas as relevant:
- **PowerShell Windows Development Expert** (for Windows-specific commands and scripts)
- **Python Principal Developer** (for FastAPI architecture and best practices)
- **PostgreSQL Principal DBA** (for database and pgvector optimization)
- **Azure Architect** (for cloud infrastructure and deployment)

## Implementation Requirements
1. **Follow existing patterns** in the codebase (check `/app/` structure)
2. **Use established models** from `/app/models/` and `/app/schemas.py`
3. **Integrate with existing services** in `/app/services/`
4. **Follow API patterns** from `/app/api/v1/endpoints/`
5. **Include proper error handling** and logging
6. **Add appropriate tests** in `/tests/unit/` or `/tests/integration/`
7. **Update documentation** in `/docs/` as needed
8. **Follow PostgreSQL best practices** for vector operations
9. **Track progress** by creating todos and marking tasks as complete

## Progress Tracking Instructions
**IMPORTANT**: You must actively track progress throughout the implementation:
1. **Create a todo list** at the start breaking down the checklist item into specific tasks
2. **Mark tasks as complete** immediately after finishing each one using the todo system
3. **Update task status** to "in_progress" when starting a task
4. **Add any discovered subtasks** to the todo list as you work
5. **Provide progress updates** as you complete each task

## Specific Needs
- [ ] Analyze existing code structure before implementing
- [ ] Create/update the necessary files following project conventions
- [ ] Add proper type hints and docstrings
- [ ] Include unit tests for new functionality
- [ ] Test integration with existing matching services
- [ ] Verify Windows PowerShell compatibility for any scripts
- [ ] Ensure pgvector compatibility if database changes are involved
- [ ] [Additional specific requirements based on checklist item]

## Success Criteria
- Code follows existing project patterns and conventions
- All imports and dependencies are properly handled
- Error handling is comprehensive and user-friendly
- Tests pass and provide good coverage
- Documentation is clear and complete
- Implementation works seamlessly with existing matching system
- PowerShell scripts work correctly on Windows
- Database operations are optimized for pgvector
- **All tasks are marked as complete** in the todo system
- Tasks are marked as complete in the checklist or plan document
- [Additional success criteria specific to the task]

## Instructions
1. **Start by creating a todo list** breaking down the checklist item into specific, actionable tasks
2. **Analyze the current az-vectordb codebase** structure to understand existing patterns
3. **Implement the checklist item** following the established architecture
4. **Mark each task as complete** as you finish it
5. **Provide a final summary** of what was accomplished

**Note**: Replace bracketed placeholders with specific details from your chosen checklist item before using this prompt.
