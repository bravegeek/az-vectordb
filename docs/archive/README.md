# Archived Documentation

This directory contains documentation files that were consolidated into the main `README.md` file.

## Archived Files

- **`README_REORGANIZED.md`** - Original documentation about the project reorganization and new structure
- **`MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`** - Original migration guide for transitioning from old to new project structure

## Why These Files Were Archived

These files were consolidated into a single, comprehensive `README.md` to:
- Provide a single source of truth for documentation
- Reduce confusion about which README to read
- Improve maintainability by having one file to update
- Follow standard open-source project practices

## Current Documentation

All the information from these files has been integrated into the main `README.md` file at the project root, organized into clear sections with a table of contents for easy navigation.

The migration guide information is now available in the "Migration Guide" section of the main README, marked as deprecated for users who need to transition from the old structure.
